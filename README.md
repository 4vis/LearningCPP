# LearningCPP
I am Learning CPP cos I havent touched code since my final year university project and with my grad role starting soon, I need to lock in and become a 10x dev.

No LLM assistance btw, pure learning only. 

The current meme thats going around is 6,7. Which I still don't understand but 6, 7.

Learing everything from https://learncpp.com
